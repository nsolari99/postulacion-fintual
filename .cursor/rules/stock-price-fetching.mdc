# Stock Price Fetching

## yfinance Integration

The application uses [yfinance](mdc:https:/pypi.org/project/yfinance) to fetch historical stock prices:

- **Implementation**: [helpers.py](mdc:helpers.py)
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API through yfinance
- **Price Type**: Adjusted close prices only

## Caching Strategy

To avoid repeated API calls, the application:

1. First checks if the requested stock price exists in the SQLite database
2. Only fetches from the API if the price is not already cached
3. Stores fetched prices in the StockPrice table for future use

## Date Handling

- For non-trading days (weekends, holidays), the application finds the closest previous valid trading day
- All date inputs use the format YYYY-MM-DD
